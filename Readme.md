- The board is generated dynamically using **JavaScript DOM manipulation**.  
- Game logic checks for win conditions after every move.  
- When AI mode is enabled, the computer selects its move based on the selected difficulty.  
- The **Minimax algorithm** (used in Hard mode) ensures the AI plays perfectly, making it unbeatable.
